/**
 * A dynamic, exponentially growing array. Each array has an associate type, for
 * which the array is 'valid'. The user must keep track of this type for a 
 * given array, e.g. through hungarian notation. 
 * 
 * This implmentation aims to be just as good as other templated implementations
 * in regards to codegen, even on `-Oz`. 
 * 
 * Methods require const type information to be passed as a parameter. Since the 
 * API is designed with the expectation that this type information is passed as 
 * a constant, codegen is only evaluated for that case. 
 * 
 * # Example
 * 
 * The following example demonstrates some basic usage of a dynamic array
 * 
 * ```c
 * struct dynarray arr = dynarray_new();
 * int values[10] = { 1, 2, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };
 * dynarray_extend(&arr, &values[0], &values[10]);
 * for (int *it = dynarray_begin(&arr); it != dynarray_end(&arr); ++it) {
 *         printf("%d ", *it);
 * }
 * puts("");
 * for (size_t _ = 0; _ < 10; ++_) {
 *         int n = *(int *)dynarray_pop(&arr, TYPEINFO(int));
 *         printf("%d ", n);
 * }
 * puts("");
 * dynarray_free(&arr);
 * ```
 * 
 * This outputs
 * 
 * ```
 * 1 2 4 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
 * 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 4 2 1 
 * ```
