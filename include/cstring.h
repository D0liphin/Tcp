/**
 * An allocated utf-8 string. This string also has the 'benefit' of always 
 * ending in a null-byte. If either of these properties are undesirable, you
 * should just use a `struct dynarray`.
 * 
 * Common convenience functions are ommitted on purpose, to indicate their 
 * performance cost. For example `.count()` is not present. This should be done
 * by creating a `codepoints` iterator and incrementing a counter yourself. 
 * If you don't want to do all that, you should probably just use a `struct
 * dynarray`.
 * 
 * Some terminology that is used throughout:
 * 
 * - `cstring`: An owned (i.e. heap-allocated) `cstr`.
 * - `cstr`: A null-terminated `char *`. A C string literal is of this type.
 * - `str`: A slice of bytes. This is valid utf8.
 * 
 * # Example
 * Print out a greeting from the user.
 * 
 * ```c
 * struct cstring greeting = cstring_is("user says: ");
 * stdin_readline(&greeting);
 * printf("%s", cstring_as_cstr(greeting));
 * cstring_free(&greeting);
 * ```
 *
 * # Why?
 * Lots of libraries expect ascii, null-terminated strings. This satisfies that 
 * requirement, by allowing you to interpret this as such. Furthermore, it is
 * quite helpful to indicate that something is (or, well, we're writing C, so
 * 'should be') utf8 i.e. "printable".
